# Perceptron  
## a Showcase
This snippet of code is a showcase on how a Perceptron works. In more details, This program gets N latest inputs of the user, which are 1s and 0s, and feeds them to a Perceptron, which in turn, tries to figure out the pattern in the input sequence. After getting enough inputs from the user, eventually the weights stop changing. In that point, if the hit rate frequency is above 50%, it is an indication that there is a recognizable pattern in the input sequence and the Perceptron has found it.
